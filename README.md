## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/api-rate-limiter-frontend.git
   cd api-rate-limiter-frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. The frontend is already configured to communicate with the backend hosted on Render, so no API base URL changes are needed.
   
   **If you are also cloning and running the backend locally, update the API_BASE_URL variable in fetchWithAuth.js file accordingly :**
   ```env
   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
- Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser.
- View real-time API usage and rate limits.
- Configure rate-limiting policies as needed.

## API Backend Integration
By default, the frontend is connected to the backend hosted on Render. If running the backend locally, update the API_BASE_URL variable accordingly.
